# space-time-modeling
I developed the `space_time_modeling` for the regression problems. <br>
You guys can perform the modeling by following the instruction at `run_local.py`, <br>
or, just use that code to run it.

PS. I always update the feature of this package. In the future, it can be run without the manual assignation, just use one function.
